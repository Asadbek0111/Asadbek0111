Personally, I am a highly motivated person. That's why, I am very interested in any useful things and have fallen in love with books. My friends think that, I did not get focus area, but  they  are wrong.   Because,  I  am   just   focusing   the whole area -_<. Even so, Programming and business occupied a large part of my interest. This is reason why I chose the "Information technology for business" faculty in MDIST. Also, I graduated S.H.Sirojiddinov academic lyceum  from math, physics and English with top score. So, I think my IQ level is not low :]. I went to Malaysia top 3th university [UUM] in 2019 for one year, and transferred university to MDIST cause of COVID-19.I think, I am able to collaborate with senior stakeholders, lead project teams and ultimately deliver client focused results on time and within budget. I actually wrote two project proposals for Bangor University and Astutium by myself. One of the my future goals is working as project manager.
